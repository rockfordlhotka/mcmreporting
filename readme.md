Missing Children Minnesota Reporting System
-------------------------------------------
This web site allows MCM personnel to add information about missing child cases, providing for anonymized reporting and analysis of the data.

Although some PII data is entered into the web forms, that data is never stored in a database. It is used purely to generate formatted printouts of the data. The non-PII data is stored in the database for later analysis.

### Technologies
This site is built using:

* ASP.NET Core Razor pages
* PostgreSQL database
* Dapper
* CSLA .NET
